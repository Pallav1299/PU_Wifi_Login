# PanjabUniversity_Wifi_Login
Logging in to PU wifi on laptop using the conventional Panjab University wifi login page, is so boring. I have been using this simple method for quite a while now. It saves time and effort.

I found a very useful python script available online on GeeksForGeeks. It is being used for logging into facebook.
With a little tinkering I changed this script to login into Panjab University wifi, using my wifi login-ID and password.
This script uses some handy third party open-source packages like "Selenium".
